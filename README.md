# UE-Kiosk-Public

This project was developed to improve processes at a university student mailroom servicing approximately 6000 on campus residents.

A RaspberryPI powered kiosk with touch screen and card reader is the student interface for this project. Students swipe their ID cards at the kiosk, and a paper prints utilizing the server default printer which provides a listing of all packages ready for pickup.
